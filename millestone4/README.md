# Fake News Detection & Verification Tool

This project provides an AI-powered tool for analyzing news content and classifying it as **Real** or **Fake**. It includes explainability features, a trusted sources system, and persistence via a **MySQL database**.

## 🚀 Features

- **News Analysis**: Submit a headline, full article, and URL to receive a prediction.
- **Explainable Output**: Highlights suspicious phrases, shows model confidence, and displays SHAP/LIME feature contributions.
- **Admin Dashboard**: (Removed) — The app focuses on single-page analysis.
- **Storage**: All submissions and predictions are stored in MySQL.
- **Containerized**: Run locally with Docker (or deploy to cloud platforms).

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Backend / UI**: Python + Streamlit
- **Database**: MySQL (via SQLAlchemy)
- **Explainability**: Keyword-based suspicious phrase detection

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1) Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then open http://localhost:8501


### 2) Run Locally (without Docker)

1. Create a Python virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```




## 🗂 Database Schema

The system includes the following tables:

- `users` - admin and user information
- `news_articles` - submitted articles
- `predictions` - model predictions and explanations
- `trusted_sources` - verified news sources
- `system_metrics` - analytics and uptime


## 🔍 How the Model Works

This prototype uses a TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model trained on a small sample dataset.

- Detects suspicious phrases (e.g., "miracle cure", "suppressed by government").
- Uses trusted sources to reduce false positives.
- Shows SHAP/LIME feature contributions for explainability.

You can extend the model with a larger dataset, use Transformers, or add more advanced explainability.


## ✅ Next Improvements

- Replace heuristic classifier with a trained model (now implemented via TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Add user authentication and improved dashboard UX (login/logout, per-user history)
- Store ground-truth labels + compute real accuracy
- Add API endpoints for integration
- Add unit tests
